  ## Abstract
In This project, we aim to an automated preparation system using a facial recognition system, the faces with masks and without masks. The emotions of the people. Also, determine the time of attendance.
 
 ## Design
 This project is one of the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements
 
 ## Data
This dataset contains faces of 31 different classes, it contains 90,000 normal faces.5000 masked faces for 525 people,and The niqab data was collected by us.  
## Algorithms:
1. Add all the necessary libraries and read the data
2. Split data and use data shuffle
3. Build deep learning models to learn a person's face, name, and feelings 
4. Test models:
-  VGG-19
-  VGG-16
- FaceNet
-  MobileNetV2
5. Visualization of the results of the models
6. Record the preparation data in an excel file

## Tools:
-  Pandas 
-  Numpy
- Sklearn
- Keras
- Matplotlip
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
